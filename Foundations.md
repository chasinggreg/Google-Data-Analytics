## Data and Gut Instinct

Analysts use data-driven decision-making and follow a step-by-step process. You have learned that there are six steps to this process:

1. **Ask** questions and define the problem.
   - Define the problem to be solved and make sure we fully understand stakeholder expectations.

2. **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information.

3. **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information.

4. **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.

5. **Share** data with your audience.

6. **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.

**Gut instinct** is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation. This isn’t always something conscious; we often pick up on signals without even realizing. You just have a “feeling” it’s right.

## Key data analyst skills
1. Curiosity  
   - Wanting to learn something.
2. Understanding Context  
   - The condition in which something exists or happens.
3. Having a technical mindset  
   - The ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way.

   - How you organize information.
5. Data strategy  
   -  The management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis.

## 5 aspects of analytical thinking
Identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner.  

1. Visualization
   - The graphical representation of information.
2. Strategy
   - Helps data analysts see what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there.
3. Problem-orientation
   - Keeping the problem top of mind throughtout the entire project.
4. Correlation

## Variations of the data life cycle

1. **Plan**: Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.

2. **Capture**: Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.

3. **Manage**: Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.

4. **Analyze**: Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.

5. **Archive**: Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.

6. **Destroy**: Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.

**Warning:** Be careful not to mix up or confuse the six stages of the data life cycle (Plan, Capture, Manage, Analyze, Archive, and Destroy) with the six phases of the data analysis life cycle (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act). They shouldn't be used or referred to interchangeably.

## Data analyst tools

### Spreadsheets
Data analysts rely on spreadsheets to collect and organize data. Two popular spreadsheet applications you will probably use a lot in your future role as a data analyst are Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. 

Spreadsheets structure data in a meaningful way by letting you 

Collect, store, organize, and sort information

Identify patterns and piece the data together in a way that works for each specific data project

Create excellent data visualizations, like graphs and charts. 

### Databases and query languages
A database is a collection of structured data stored in a computer system. Some popular Structured Query Language (SQL) programs include MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and BigQuery.

#### Query languages 

- Allow analysts to isolate specific information from a database(s)

- Make it easier for you to learn and understand the requests made to databases

- Allow analysts to select, create, add, or download data from a database for analysis

### Visualization tools
Data analysts use a number of visualization tools, like graphs, maps, tables, charts, and more. Two popular visualization tools are Tableau and Looker.

These tools 

- Turn complex numbers into a story that people can understand 

- Help stakeholders come up with conclusions that lead to informed decisions and effective business strategies  

- Have multiple features 

   - **Tableau**'s simple drag-and-drop feature lets users create interactive graphs in dashboards and   

      worksheets 

   - **Looker** communicates directly with a database, allowing you to connect your data right to the visual 

      tool you choose 

A career as a data analyst also involves using programming languages, like R and Python, which are used a lot for statistical analysis, visualization, and other data analysis.

## Planning a data visualization
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information.  

![Data Visualization](/assets/data_viz.png)

### Steps to plan a data visualization
**Step 1: Explore the data for patterns**
  - While reviewing the data try to notice a pattern  

**Step 2: Plan your visuals**  
  - Determine the best visual for the audience; always consider the audience.

**Step 3: Create your visuals**  
  - Start creating the visualizations, keeping in mind the audience and presentation means.

## Build your data visualization toolkit  

There are many different tools you can use for data visualization.  

You can use the visualizations tools in your spreadsheet to create simple visualizations such as line and bar charts.  

You can use more advanced tools such as Tableau that allow you to integrate data into dashboard-style visualizations.  

If you’re working with the programming language R you can use the visualization tools in RStudio.  

Your choice of visualization will be driven by a variety of drivers including the size of your data, the process you used for analyzing your data (spreadsheet, or databases/queries, or programming languages). For now, just consider the basics. 
### Spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets)
 The built-in charts and graphs in spreadsheets made the process of creating visuals quick and easy. Spreadsheets are great for creating simple visualizations like bar graphs and pie charts, and even provide some advanced visualizations like maps, and waterfall and funnel diagrams.  
 ### Visualization software (Tableau)
Tableau is a popular data visualization tool that lets you pull data from nearly any system and turn it into compelling visuals or actionable insights. The platform offers built-in visual best practices, which makes analyzing and sharing data fast, easy, and (most importantly) useful. Tableau works well with a wide variety of data and includes an interactive dashboard that lets you and your stakeholders click to explore the data interactively.

You can start exploring Tableau from the [How-to Video resources](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources). Tableau Public is free, easy to use, and full of helpful information. The Resources page is a one-stop-shop for how-to videos, examples, and datasets for you to practice with. To explore what other data analysts are sharing on Tableau, visit the [Viz of the Day](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/?tab=viz-of-the-day&type=viz-of-the-day) page where you will find beautiful visuals ranging from the [Hunt for (Habitable) Planets](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/hunt-habitable-planets?tab=viz-of-the-day&type=viz-of-the-day) to [Who’s Talking in Popular Films](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/whos-talking-popular-films?tab=viz-of-the-day&type=viz-of-the-day).  
#### Programming language (R with RStudio) 
A lot of data analysts work with a programming language called R. Most people who work with R end up also using RStudio, an integrated developer environment (IDE), for their data visualization needs. As with Tableau, you can create dashboard-style data visualizations using RStudio.  

![RStudio](/assets/rstudio_dashboard.png)

Check out their website to learn more about [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/).

You could easily spend days exploring all the resources provided at RStudio.com, but the [RStudio Cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) and the [RStudio Visualize Data Primer](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/3) are great places to start.

## Decoding the job description
The data analyst role is one of many job titles that contain the word “analyst.” 

To name a few others that sound similar but may not be the same role:

- **Business analyst** — analyzes data to help businesses improve processes, products, or services

- **Data analytics consultant** — analyzes the systems and models for using data

- **Data engineer — prepares** and integrates data from different sources for analytical use

- **Data scientist** — uses expert skills in technology and social science to find trends through data analysis

- **Data specialist** — organizes or converts data for use in databases or software systems

- **Operations analyst** — analyzes data to assess the performance of business operations and workflows

Data analysts, data scientists, and data specialists sound very similar but focus on different tasks. As you start to browse job listings online, you might notice that companies’ job descriptions seem to combine these roles or look for candidates who may have overlapping skills. The fact that companies often blur the lines between them means that you should take special care when reading the job descriptions and the skills required. 

The table below illustrates some of the overlap and distinctions between them:  

![Data Job descriptions](/assets/data_jobs.png)

## Job specializations by industry 
We learned that the data specialist role concentrates on in-depth knowledge of databases. In similar fashion, other specialist roles for data analysts can focus on in-depth knowledge of specific industries. For example, in a job as a business analyst you might wear some different hats than in a more general position as a data analyst. As a business analyst, you would likely collaborate with managers, share your data findings, and maybe explain how a small change in the company’s project management system could save the company 3% each quarter. Although you would still be working with data all the time, you would focus on using the data to improve business operations, efficiencies, or the bottom line.

Other industry-specific specialist positions that you might come across in your data analyst job search include:

- **Marketing analyst** — analyzes market conditions to assess the potential sales of products and services 

- **HR/payroll analyst** — analyzes payroll data for inefficiencies and errors

- **Financial analyst** — analyzes financial status by collecting, monitoring, and reviewing data

- **Risk analyst** — analyzes financial documents, economic conditions, and client data to help companies determine the level of risk involved in making a particular business decision

- **Healthcare analyst** — analyzes medical data to improve the business aspect of hospitals and medical facilities
