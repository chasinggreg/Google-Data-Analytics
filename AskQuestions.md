## From issue to action: The six data analysis phases
There are six data analysis phases that will help you make seamless decisions: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. Keep in mind, these are different from the data life cycle, which describes the changes data goes through over its lifetime. Let’s walk through the steps to see how they can help you solve problems you might face on the job.  

![Ask](/assets/Ask-1.png)

## Step 1: Ask
It’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it is. These are some things to consider:

- Define the problem you’re trying to solve 

- Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations

- Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions

- Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication

- Take a step back and see the whole situation in context

**Questions to ask yourself in this step:**   
1. What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?

2. Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?  

![Prepare](/assets/prepare-1.png)

## Step 2: Prepare 
You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful. You might use your business task to decide: 

- What metrics to measure

- Locate data in your database

- Create security measures to protect that data

**Questions to ask yourself in this step:**
1. What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?

2. What research do I need to do?

![Process](/assets/process-1.png)

## Step 3: Process
Clean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This might mean:

- Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data 

- Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces

- Removing repeated entries

- Checking as much as possible for bias in the data

**Questions to ask yourself in this step:**
1. What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?

2. How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?

![Analyze](/assets/analyze-1.png)

## Step 4: Analyze 
You will want to think analytically about your data. At this stage, you might sort and format your data to make it easier to: 

- Perform calculations

- Combine data from multiple sources

- Create tables with your results

**Questions to ask yourself in this step:**
1. What story is my data telling me?

2. How will my data help me solve this problem?

3. Who needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?

![Share](/assets/share-1.png)

## Step 5: Share
Everyone shares their results differently so be sure to summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals of your analysis using data viz tools like graphs or dashboards. This is your chance to show the stakeholders you have solved their problem and how you got there. Sharing will certainly help your team:  

- Make better decisions

- Make more informed decisions

- Lead to stronger outcomes

- Successfully communicate your findings

**Questions to ask yourself in this step:**
1. How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?

2. What would help me understand this if I were the listener?

![Share](/assets/act-1.png)

## Step 6: Act
Now it’s time to act on your data. You will take everything you have learned from your data analysis and put it to use. This could mean providing your stakeholders with recommendations based on your findings so they can make data-driven decisions.

**Questions to ask yourself in this step:**
1. How can I use the feedback I received during the share phase (step 5) to actually meet the stakeholder’s needs and expectations?

These six steps can help you to break the data analysis process into smaller, manageable parts, which is called **structured thinking**. This process involves four basic activities:

1. Recognizing the current problem or situation

2. Organizing available information 

3. Revealing gaps and opportunities

4. Identifying your options

When you are starting out in your career as a data analyst, it is normal to feel pulled in a few different directions with your role and expectations. Following processes like the ones outlined here and using structured thinking skills can help get you back on track, fill in any gaps and let you know exactly what you need.

## Common Problem Types
1. Making predictions
   - Using data to make an informed decision about how things may be in the future.
2. Categorizing things
   - Assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features.
3. Spotting something unusual
   - Identifying data that is different from the norm.
4. Identifying themes
   - Grouping categorized information into broader concepts.
5. Discovering connections
   - Finding similar challenges faced by different entities and combining data and insights to address.
6. Finding patterns
   - Using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again.  

![Problem Types](/assets/problem_types.png)

**Making predictions**  
A company that wants to know the best advertising method to bring in new customers is an example of a problem requiring analysts to make predictions. Analysts with data on location, type of media, and number of new customers acquired as a result of past ads can't guarantee future results, but they can help predict the best placement of advertising to reach the target audience.  

**Categorizing things**   
An example of a problem requiring analysts to categorize things is a company's goal to improve customer satisfaction. Analysts might classify customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores. This could help identify top-performing customer service representatives or help correlate certain actions taken with higher customer satisfaction scores.  

**Spotting something unusual**  
A company that sells smart watches that help people monitor their health would be interested in designing their software to spot something unusual. Analysts who have analyzed aggregated health data can help product developers determine the right algorithms to spot and set off alarms when certain data doesn't trend normally.  

**Identifying themes**  
User experience (UX) designers might rely on analysts to analyze user interaction data. Similar to problems that require analysts to categorize things, usability improvement projects might require analysts to identify themes to help prioritize the right product features for improvement. Themes are most often used to help researchers explore certain aspects of data. In a user study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes.  

By now you might be wondering if there is a difference between categorizing things and identifying themes. The best way to think about it is: categorizing things involves assigning items to categories; identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.  

**Discovering connections**  
A third-party logistics company working with another company to get shipments delivered to customers on time is a problem requiring analysts to discover connections. By analyzing the wait times at shipping hubs, analysts can determine the appropriate schedule changes to increase the number of on-time deliveries.  

**Finding patterns**  
Minimizing downtime caused by machine failure is an example of a problem requiring analysts to find patterns in data. For example, by analyzing maintenance data, they might discover that most failures happen if regular maintenance is delayed by more than a 15-day window.

## SMART questions  
**S**pecific  
**M**easurable  
**A**ction-oriented  
**R**elevant  
**T**ime-bound  

![SMART](/assets/SMART-1.png)

## Examples of SMART questions
Here's an example that breaks down the thought process of turning a problem question into one or more SMART questions using the SMART method: **What features do people look for when buying a new car?**

- **Specific:** Does the question focus on a particular car feature?

- **Measurable:** Does the question include a feature rating system?

- **Action-oriented:** Does the question influence creation of different or new feature packages?

- **Relevant:** Does the question identify which features make or break a potential car purchase?

- **Time-bound:** Does the question validate data on the most popular features from the last three years? 

Questions should be **open-ended**. This is the best way to get responses that will help you accurately qualify or disqualify potential solutions to your specific problem. So, based on the thought process, possible SMART questions might be:

On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the most important) how important is your car having four-wheel drive?

What are the top five features you would like to see in a car package?

What features, if included with four-wheel drive, would make you more inclined to buy the car?

How much more would you pay for a car with four-wheel drive?

Has four-wheel drive become more or less popular in the last three years?

## Things to avoid when asking questions
**Leading questions:** questions that only have a particular response

Example: **This product is too expensive, isn’t it?**

This is a leading question because it suggests an answer as part of the question. A better question might be, “What is your opinion of this product?” There are tons of answers to that question, and they could include information about usability, features, accessories, color, reliability, and popularity, on top of price. Now, if your problem is actually focused on pricing, you could ask a question like “What price (or price range) would make you consider purchasing this product?” This question would provide a lot of different measurable responses.

**Closed-ended questions:** questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only

Example: **Were you satisfied with the customer trial?**

This is a closed-ended question because it doesn’t encourage people to expand on their answer. It is really easy for them to give one-word responses that aren’t very informative. A better question might be, “What did you learn about customer experience from the trial.” This encourages people to provide more detail besides “It went well.”

**Vague questions:** questions that aren’t specific or don’t provide context

Example: **Does the tool work for you?**

This question is too vague because there is no context. Is it about comparing the new tool to the one it replaces? You just don’t know. A better inquiry might be, “When it comes to data entry, is the new tool faster, slower, or about the same as the old tool? If faster, how much time is saved? If slower, how much time is lost?” These questions give context (data entry) and help frame responses that are measurable (time).

**Quantitative Data**  
- Specific and objective measures of numerical facts.

**Qualitative Data**
- Subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics.

![Quantitative Data and Qualitative Data](/assets/quantitative_qualitative.png)  

## The Big Reveal

**Dashboard**
- Monitors live, incoming data.

Pros
- Dynamic, automatic, and interactive
- More stakeholder access
- Low maintenance

Cons
- Labor-intensive design
- Can be confusing
- Potentially uncleaned data

**Report**
- Static collection of data given to stakeholders periodically  

Pros  
- High-level historical data
- Easy to design
- Pre-cleaned and sorted data

Cons
- Continual maintenance
- Less visuallyy appealing
- Static

**Pivot Table**
- A data summarization tool that is used in data processing. Pivot tables are used to summarize, sort, reorganize, group, count, total or averaga data stored in a database.  

**Metric**
- Single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement.

## The beauty of dashboards
Dashboards are powerful visual tools that help you tell your data story. A **dashboard** organizes information from multiple datasets into one central location, offering huge time-savings. Data analysts use dashboards to track, analyze, and visualize data in order to answer questions and solve problems. For a basic idea of what dashboards look like, refer to this article: [6 real-world examples of business intelligence dashboards](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/business-intelligence-dashboards-examples). Tableau is one tool that is used to create dashboards and is covered later in the program.

The following table summarizes the benefits of using a dashboard for both data analysts and their stakeholders.  

| **Benefits**        | **For Data Analysts**           | **For Stakeholders**  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Centralization**      | Sharing a single source of data with all stakeholders | Working with a comprehensive view of data, initiatives, objectives, projects, processes, and more |
| **Visualization**      | Showing and updating live, incoming data in real time*      |   Spotting changing trends and patterns more quickly |
| **Insightfulness** | `Pulling relevant information from different datasets      |    Understanding the story behind the numbers to keep track of goals and make data-driven decisions |
| **Customization** | Creating custom views dedicated to a specific person, project, or presentation of the data      |    Drilling down to more specific areas of specialized interest or concern |

*It is important to remember that changed data is pulled into dashboards automatically only if the data structure is the same. If the data structure changes, you have to update the dashboard design before the data can update live.*
## Creating a dashboard
Here is a process you can follow to create a dashboard:

1. Identify the stakeholders who need to see the data and how they will use it

To get started with this, you need to ask effective questions. Check out this [Requirements Gathering Worksheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/looker-elearning-resources/Requirements+Gathering+Worksheet.pdf) to explore a wide range of good questions you can use to identify relevant stakeholders and their data needs. This is a great resource to help guide you through this process again and again. 

2. Design the dashboard (what should be displayed)

   - Use these tips to help make your dashboard design clear, easy to follow, and simple:

   - Use a clear header to label the information

   - Add short text descriptions to each visualization

    - Show the most important information at the top

3. Create mock-ups if desired

This is optional, but a lot of data analysts like to sketch out their dashboards before creating them. 

4. Select the visualizations you will use on the dashboard

You have a lot of options here and it all depends on what data story you are telling. If you need to show a change of values over time, line charts or bar graphs might be the best choice. If your goal is to show how each part contributes to the whole amount being reported, a pie or donut chart is probably a better choice.  

![Dashboard Components](/assets/dashboard_comp.png)

To learn more about choosing the right visualizations, check out Tableau’s galleries:

For more samples of area charts, column charts, and other visualizations, visit Tableau’s Viz Gallery. This gallery is full of great examples that were created using real data; explore this resource on your own to get some inspiration. 

Explore Tableau’s Viz of the Day to see visualizations curated by the community. These are visualizations created by Tableau users and are a great way to learn more about how other data analysts are using data visualization tools.  

5. Create filters as needed

Filters show certain data while hiding the rest of the data in a dashboard. This can be a big help to identify patterns while keeping the original data intact. It is common for data analysts to use and share the same dashboard, but manage their part of it with a filter. To dig deeper into filters and find an example of filters in action, you can visit Tableau’s page on Filter Actions. This is a useful resource to save and come back to when you start practicing using filters in Tableau on your own. 

### Dashboards are part of a business journey
Just like how the dashboard on an airplane shows the pilot their flight path, your dashboard does the same for your stakeholders. It helps them navigate the path of the project inside the data. If you add clear markers and highlight important points on your dashboard, users will understand where your data story is headed. Then, you can work together to make sure the business gets where it needs to go.

## Big and small data

As a data analyst, you will work with data both big and small. Both kinds of data are valuable, but they play very different roles.  

![Big and Small Data](/assets/BigSmallData.png)

Whether you work with big or small data, you can use it to help stakeholders improve business processes, answer questions, create new products, and much more. But there are certain challenges and benefits that come with big data and the following table explores the differences between big and small data.  

| **Small Data**        | **Big Data**           |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Describes a data set made up of specific metrics over a short, well-defined time period | Describes large, less-specific data sets that cover a long time period |
| Usually organized and analyzed in spreadsheets | Usually kept in a database and queried |
| Likely to be used by small and midsize businesses | Likely to be used by large organizations |
| Simple to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent | Takes a lot of effort to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent |
| Usually already a manageable size for analysis | Usually needs to be broken into smaller pieces in order to be organized and analyzed effectively for decision-making |

## Challenges and benefits  
Here are some **challenges** you might face when working with big data:

- A lot of organizations deal with data overload and way too much unimportant or irrelevant information. 

- Important data can be hidden deep down with all of the non-important data, which makes it harder to find and use. This can lead to slower and more inefficient decision-making time frames.

- The data you need isn’t always easily accessible. 

- Current technology tools and solutions still struggle to provide measurable and reportable data. This can lead to unfair algorithmic bias. 

- There are gaps in many big data business solutions.

Now for the good news! Here are some **benefits** that come with big data:

- When large amounts of data can be stored and analyzed, it can help companies identify more efficient ways of doing business and save a lot of time and money.

- Big data helps organizations spot the trends of customer buying patterns and satisfaction levels, which can help them create new products and solutions that will make customers happy.

- By analyzing big data, businesses get a much better understanding of current market conditions, which can help them stay ahead of the competition.

- As in our earlier social media example, big data helps companies keep track of their online presence—especially feedback, both good and bad, from customers. This gives them the information they need to improve and protect their brand.  

## The three (or four) V words for big data
When thinking about the benefits and challenges of big data, it helps to think about the three Vs: **volume**, **variety**, and **velocity**. Volume describes the amount of data. Variety describes the different kinds of data. Velocity describes how fast the data can be processed. Some data analysts also consider a fourth V: **veracity**. Veracity refers to the quality and reliability of the data. These are all important considerations related to processing huge, complex data sets.  


| Volume | Variety | Velocity | Veracity |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| The amount of data | The different kinds of data | How fast the data can be processed | The quality and reliability of the data |
