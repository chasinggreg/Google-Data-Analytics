## Data and Gut Instinct

Analysts use data-driven decision-making and follow a step-by-step process. You have learned that there are six steps to this process:

1. **Ask** questions and define the problem.

2. **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information.

3. **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information.

4. **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.

5. **Share** data with your audience.

6. **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.

**Gut instinct** is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation. This isn’t always something conscious; we often pick up on signals without even realizing. You just have a “feeling” it’s right.
