## Data and Gut Instinct

Analysts use data-driven decision-making and follow a step-by-step process. You have learned that there are six steps to this process:

1. **Ask** questions and define the problem.
   - Define the problem to be solved and make sure we fully understand stakeholder expectations.

2. **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information.

3. **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information.

4. **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.

5. **Share** data with your audience.

6. **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.

**Gut instinct** is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation. This isn’t always something conscious; we often pick up on signals without even realizing. You just have a “feeling” it’s right.

## Key data analyst skills
1. Curiosity  
   - Wanting to learn something.
2. Understanding Context  
   - The condition in which something exists or happens.
3. Having a technical mindset  
   - The ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way.
4. Data design  
   - How you organize information.
5. Data strategy  
   -  The management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis.

## 5 aspects of analytical thinking
Identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner.  

1. Visualization
   - The graphical representation of information.
2. Strategy
   - Helps data analysts see what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there.
3. Problem-orientation
   - Keeping the problem top of mind throughtout the entire project.
4. Correlation
   - Bring able to identify a correlation between two or more pieces of data.
5. Big-picture and detail-oriented thinking
   - Like looking at a complete puzzle.

## Variations of the data life cycle

1. Plan: Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.

2. Capture: Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.

3. Manage: Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.

4. Analyze: Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.

5. Archive: Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.

6. Destroy: Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.

**Warning:** Be careful not to mix up or confuse the six stages of the data life cycle (Plan, Capture, Manage, Analyze, Archive, and Destroy) with the six phases of the data analysis life cycle (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act). They shouldn't be used or referred to interchangeably.

## Data analyst tools

### Spreadsheets
Data analysts rely on spreadsheets to collect and organize data. Two popular spreadsheet applications you will probably use a lot in your future role as a data analyst are Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. 

Spreadsheets structure data in a meaningful way by letting you 

Collect, store, organize, and sort information

Identify patterns and piece the data together in a way that works for each specific data project

Create excellent data visualizations, like graphs and charts. 

### Databases and query languages
A database is a collection of structured data stored in a computer system. Some popular Structured Query Language (SQL) programs include MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and BigQuery.

#### Query languages 

- Allow analysts to isolate specific information from a database(s)

- Make it easier for you to learn and understand the requests made to databases

- Allow analysts to select, create, add, or download data from a database for analysis

### Visualization tools
Data analysts use a number of visualization tools, like graphs, maps, tables, charts, and more. Two popular visualization tools are Tableau and Looker.

These tools 

- Turn complex numbers into a story that people can understand 

- Help stakeholders come up with conclusions that lead to informed decisions and effective business strategies  

- Have multiple features 

   - **Tableau**'s simple drag-and-drop feature lets users create interactive graphs in dashboards and   

      worksheets 

   - **Looker** communicates directly with a database, allowing you to connect your data right to the visual 

      tool you choose 

A career as a data analyst also involves using programming languages, like R and Python, which are used a lot for statistical analysis, visualization, and other data analysis.
